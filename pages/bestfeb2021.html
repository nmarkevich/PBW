                <p>Once Upon a DRAGON'S FIRE</p>
                <img src="C:\Users\natal\Automation\Udacity\Project1-PBW\PBW\images\dragonsfire.gif"></img>
                <p>The second title in a new series about how magical creatures came to have their gifts. Do you know how dragons got their fire? It all began once upon a magic kingdom, when a fearsome, terrifying dragon stalked the land. He was so mean he ate kittens for breakfast, he was so scary he made children scream, and he was so evil that he blew huge storms out of his jaws, which is why it was always so cold.
                   Or so the stories said. When two children called Freya and Sylas met the dragon, they found something very different indeed..
