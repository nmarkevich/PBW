                    <h4>Once Upon a DRAGON'S FIRE</h4>
                    <p>The second title in a new series about how magical creatures came to have their gifts. Do you
                        know
                        how dragons got their fire? It all began once upon a magic kingdom, when a fearsome, terrifying
                        dragon stalked the land. He was so mean he ate kittens for breakfast, he was so scary he made
                        children scream, and he was so evil that he blew huge storms out of his jaws, which is why it
                        was
                        always so cold.
                        Or so the stories said. When two children called Freya and Sylas met the dragon, they found
                        something very different indeed..

                    <h4>Ada Twist, Scientist</h4>
                    <p>K-Gr 2—Ada Marie Twist is an inquisitive African American second grader and a born scientist. She
                        possesses a keen yet peculiar need to question everything she encounters, whether it be a
                        tick-tocking clock, a pointy-stemmed rose, or the hairs in her dad's nose. Ada's parents and her
                        teacher, Miss Greer, have their hands full as the child's science experiments wreak day-to-day
                        havoc. On the first day of spring, the title character is tinkering outside her home when she
                        notices an unpleasant odor. She sets out to discover what might have caused it. Beaty shows Ada
                        using the scientific method in developing hypotheses in her smelly pursuit. The little girl
                        demonstrates trial and error in her endeavors, while appreciating her family's full support. In
                        one experiment, she douses fragrances on her cat and then attempts to place the feline in the
                        washing machine. Her parents, startled by her actions, send her to the Thinking Chair, where she
                        starts to reflect on the art of questioning by writing her thoughts on the wall—now the Great Thinking
                        Hall.
                        VERDICT A winner for storytime reading and for young children interested in STEM activities.
